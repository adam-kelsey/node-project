# node-project
This was following a tutorial on an introduction to Node and Express on egghead.io, but I am going to find a different guide to gain a base knowledge and start building on my own. The videos became unfollowable very quickly into the tutorial because on the start of each new video, code was added outside the video. It got to the point where I could not make the project work without having to study the github closely to see what I was missing, as code was not discussed and was randomly added.
